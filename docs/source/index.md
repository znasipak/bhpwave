# bhpwave

**BHPWave** (or {code}`bhpwave`) is a C++ library wrapped in Python that generates gravitational waveforms
of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) using the adiabatic approximation of black hole
perturbation theory and the self-force formalism. The model is restricted to binaries in which the small body is
undergoing a quasi-circular, equatorial inspiral into a rotating massive black hole. Details of the model are published at [Phys. Rev. D 109, 044020 (2024)]( 	
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.044020) and the Github repository [bhpwave-article](https://github.com/znasipak/bhpwave-article).

Installation guidelines and a quick tutorial can be found in the
{doc}`usage` section. Relevant background on the waveform generation model is
outlined in the {doc}`background` section. Additionally, citations and literature references
are provided in the {doc}`ref` section, along with links to related open-source
waveform models. Detailed documentation can be found in the {doc}`api/api` section.
